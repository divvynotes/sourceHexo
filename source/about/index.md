# About Us
 We are 3 highschoolers that have come together to resolve the issue that many students have: finding accessible notes, educational tools, etc. in one easy-to-use site; therefore, that is essentially what Divvynotes is: an educational site designed through Github that offers free notes for multiple subjects along with a wide community of users and editors who can communicate on the site.

# Work in progress
