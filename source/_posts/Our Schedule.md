## What we have done:

1.) We first were introduced to the business world. For our first class, we had to research on terms and present them for the class.
2.) Danny introduced us to Github. We spent the next few classes downloading the app, making sure that it ran properly, etc.
3.) The 3 of us discussed our business plan. For homework we had prepared business ideas and we had decided on an idea Julia had written down for a student app. Later we decided on the name Divvynotes. We made an email and a Github for this business.
4.) We had our meeting in person at Danny's office and continued to explore with Github. Danny showed us his own website.
5.) The three of us practiced with Github, creating new repositories, projects, designs within the span of a few weeks. We had sessions in person as well as online. 
6.) We purchased a domain in class through GoDaddy.com and made our website name official. Chris also experimented with logo designs.
7.) In August, we finally established our own site and started to add our own details, posts, images, etc. to the website.
8.) We are in the middle of creating a presentation to introduce our work and project to the parents. The workload has been split. Julia is to work mainly on creating new posts, Justin and Chris on the presentation while adding their own small details to the website.
