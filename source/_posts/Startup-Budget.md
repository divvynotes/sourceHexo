# Divvynotes startup funding

###### *This post will outline all direct costs involved in starting up the company*



# 1. Domain registration

The below information is a screenshot from GoDaddy on August 29th of 2021 registering for the domain name of:

`divvynotes.com` and `divvynotes.ca`

The cost shown above is the subtotal; the total should be slightly higher.

# 2. Incorporating Divvynotes

We have discussed earlier that we intend to start Divvynotes as a limited incorporation. The following will outline the prices and steps to incorporation.

Refer to this link for some things to do to start off: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/business/managing-a-business/starting-a-business/starting-a-restaurant-in-bc/register-your-business

We have already checked the name `Divvynotes Inc.` on BC registry services (https://www.bcregistry.ca/namerequest) on August 29th 2021.

The specific steps to incorporating in British Columbia is found here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/business/managing-a-business/permits-licences/businesses-incorporated-companies/incorporated-companies#incorporate

To summarize, incorporating will take 5 steps:

1. Confirm business structure
2. Reserve name **($30)**
3. Establish articles (rules)
4. Prepare agreement
5. Apply for incorporation **($350)**

Thus, the costs to incorporating totals to **$380**.

*It is noteworthy to mention that establishing articles is quite a complicated process, and that perhaps it may be desired to hire a professional to establish them, which may add to the costs.*

# 3. Conclusion

Our subtotals are $51.96 + $350 + $30 = $431.96. Our total will be higher than that.

Of course, there is the possibility of hiring a professional to draft the company articles (which is excluded from the sum above), but this cost can vary widely, should we schoose this option.
