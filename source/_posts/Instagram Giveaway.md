# Instagram Giveaway

During the spring of 2022, we decided to create an instagram giveaway to increase our follower account and interactions. We accomplished this through multiple meetings discussing the rewards and the paramters of the giveaway. Finally, we decided on giving away 3 x $15 giftcards, as they were the most universal gift card we could give out. 

The paramaters were as follows:

- Follow divvynotes
- Tag a friend in the comments
- Repost this post on your story

During the week of the giveaway, we closely analyzed the interactions with our giveaway post and used this information to determine future goals and show the growth of our company to our investors. Over 60+ particpants interacted with our posts, and the post reached over 174 accounts. We were thrilled with the results, and we learned that Instagram giveaways were much more effective than other types of giveaways. 

Before this post, we had created another giveaway, however the paramters were slightly different and required particpiants to make an account on divvynotes.com as well as post 4+ notes on our website. We soon realized that these paramters were expecting too much from the particpants, and this was confirmed when there was no activity following the giveaway. 



This giveaway was an important event that allowed us to learn about which smart ways to market our products as well as spread the word about our site. Instagram also has many great tools that allowed us to understand user interactions and visualize the data.

Overall, this experience was highly beneficial and we are considering hosting another giveaway to furthermore increase interactions with our instagram account.
