# The challenge of getting WPGA to recognize Divvynotes Part I

Some context first: in the recent weeks, and the weeks to follow, we have and will continue to try to advertise by means of offline events at our respective schools. However, to achieve that, we should definitely first talk to our schools to get permission to advertise, and get recognition. 

Earlier this week, on Monday, April 11th, I approached my school's (West Point Grey Academy) Head of Senior School about the subject. Whilst Mr. Parker commended me on the initiative of creating an entrepreneurship project of Divvynotes, he was concerned with technological ethics -- in other words, preventing cheating through Divvynotes. This presented us an interesting challenge, especially since we did not ever consider the ethics side of Divvynotes beforehand. Indeed, it is entirely possible that Divvynotes could unintentionally promote the sharing of test questions and answers due to its convenience, and as of now, there are neither rules nor enforcement in place to prevent that. Whilst our intentions of creating Divvynotes was to facilitate the sharing of notes to ease the process of reviewing for tests, certain vultures who may wish to exploit the system always exist. 

The senior school head sent me to talk to different IT teachers at WPGA to hopefully resolve the conflict. Like the head of school, upon approaching individual teachers they expressed optimism on the project's initiative, and fortunately they agreed that a resolution to this ethics issue could be as simple as having an explicit rule on registration. However, having our customers read the terms and conditions is as unlikely as a cold day in hell, let alone having existing users notice a change in the T&C. As such, it was suggested that a pop-up appear to maximize awareness of the new rule. Another suggestion was to implement occasional manual pruning of prohibited content. For this, we could hire trustworthy students and give them service hours in return! At the end of the week, I believe that I have gathered all the information I needed from teachers, and the next step would be to implement these changes then return to the Head of Senior School at WPGA to have another attempt at publicizing the site and getting official recognition for it.

From this event, a valuable lesson was learnt: technology is powerful, and there is a myriad of anything that anyone can create and share. However, this ability to create must be used wisely -- exploitation by those driven by greed must be pruned. We realize our mistake of forgetting to consider the ethics side of technology, we now understand there may be unintentional consequences of our creations: that vultures can use it with malice, even if our own intentions were pure at heart.
