# The success of our Instagram commercial

With the creation of our Instagram account some months ago, it sat empty, gaining little of others' attention. Within the last month, we began creating posts welcoming people to our Instagram account and our divvynotes.com site, and how to use it to post notes! This attracted a small group of close friends who followed our Instagram account. However, this was not enough, and we wanted to create some higher-quality content to let more people know of our organization's presence. 

Enter our first ever video commercial! This project took us a little more than one month from the beginnings of its planning, to the ultimate click to post it. The reason why the 90-second video took us this long was due to an unending series of setbacks that prevented us from getting together to film. 

I shall now discuss the process and milestones of the project, in addition to some challenges we faced each step. Beginning with the planning, we wrote up the script for the commercial. The script consisted of a cast of three characters: a conversation between two students complaining about an upcoming test, then a salesman interrupts to advertise Divvynotes, how it can help them!

The greatest effect the production had was the amount of accounts and views that it gathered. Compared to all our previous posts, the commercial reached the most accounts, and as of April 9th, got 206 views. This was a huge boost to how our Instagram account held user engagement, and the commercial arguably set our account up for a possible giveaway. More on this giveaway is discussed in depth within another article within our site.

Taken from an optimistic perspective, the commercial along with its success marks as what possibly be the dawn of Divvynotes' expansion in influence on Instagram. It sets in stone the beginnings of our presence on Instagram. Though 207 views is not much, it certainly is impressive considering the measly 24 followers we had at the time of posting. We are hopeful that we can continue this trend with forthcoming posts. Though making breakthroughs with every post is quite the daunting task, it is nonetheless imperative that Divvynotes at the very least maintain its presence by posting regularly on Instagram.  

Whatever our next step is, here's to the future of Divvynotes' growth!
