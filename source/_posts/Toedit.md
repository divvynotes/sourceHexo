Firstly, we started class at 6:30. Danny had us present what we had done with homework as we usually do. Chris went, then Justin, then Julia.
Everyone shared their screen and spent 5-10 minutes introducing their work. This is important because we want to see our weekly progress. This is also a time for us to ask questions and revisit the website.
Secondly, Danny gave us 5 minutes to write the script on our presentation to the parents next week. He ended up giving us more than that so around 10-15 minutes.
Thirdly, we presented as if we were in front of the parents, Chris went first then Justin then Julia. This took us around 30 minutes to finish.
Here are some pictures of Chris' presentation:
