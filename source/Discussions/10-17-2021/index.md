3. How many shares in total and given? -> 75 shares given (25 per investor), 1500 total.

We will have 75 shares available to our investors, each costing 20 dollars initially. We have a total of 1500 shares.



4. What power do we give them in the contract (can they make decisions, etc.)?

They shouldnâ€™t be able to make decisions, at least without our confirmation. They should be able to oversee our operation, but not change our process. On some occasions may they object to our decisions, for example when they all vote to oppose our decision (But 2 out of 3 of us also must object to the decision as well).



5. Policies on withdrawals? 

They cannot withdraw early, otherwise, they will be penalized through fees and taxes. Investors can only withdraw 4% of their investment each year (4% rule.) You can only withdraw when our business has reached a certain threshmark/goal that was agreed on.



6. Risks? 

There will be interest rates and they will either drop or increase. Liquidity risk (you may lose money because you are unable to sell off your investments for the price/higher than how much you bought it for.) Equity risk (drop in the market price of shares that result to risk of loss.)
