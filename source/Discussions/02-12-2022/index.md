## Detailed giveaway event plans

Chris is taking ownership of this event



* Budget:
    * $45 dollars total
    * 3x$15 gift cards
* External rules (for users’ to see and know):
    * For every milestone that a user reaches, they get an additional ticket in the lottery draw for the event
        * A milestone is denoted by the posting of 4 notes, where each note have to be at least 2 pages if they post repeatedly in the same subject
    * Multiple winners:
        * Three winners, $15  gift card each
    * Duration:
        * Event will last for the duration of one entire week
* Internal rules (for only us to know):
    * Install a plugin that keeps track of posts from individual users
* Gift cards choices:
    * Make a specific list of approved gift cards winner(s) can choose from
        * For example: Apple gift card, Steam, Amazon etc.
    * Or, VISA gift card for general use
        * However, there are limitations: some places might not accept the card
        * Also requires physical delivery to card
    * We decided that the reward gift cards should be purchased rom Amazon, to attack the most amount of motivation from participants to get it! 
* To send gift cards to recipients:
    * Services like Amazon and others allow the emailing of gift cards
* Expected results:
    * We expect 30 members to secure at least one ticket – at least 120 notes over the course of the event
    * We are not expecting many new members to join as a result of the event
* Giveaway duration: 1 week for advertising + 2 weeks to join and post
* Approximate Date: Wednesday, Feb 16th or as soon as we get the commercial out
* Advertising of event:
    * Gather Instagram follower base so we can get our message across to more people
        * Tonight, advertise the Divvynotes Instagram account
