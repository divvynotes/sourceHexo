# Discussion February 26th



* Julia: return the physical gift cards to Amazon, and buy 3 $15 electronic versions of them, so that we can email directly to the winners the gift cards
    * This will be easier to distribute, for both now and in the future, for purposes of convenience and health safety
* Increasing actions done from viewers on our Instagram account:
    * Find a foundation that could publicize our company
    * Canada Sunshine foundation – Julia knows more about it
    * 


# Retrospective for the failure to meet February’s goals



* **One goal**: to acquire 200 members on the entire site
    * Progress: 73 members including staff; 68 or 69 non staff accounts
* Reasons we did not meet the requirements:
    * Delayed promotional events:
        * The commercial was originally planned in [January 29th's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Va7QSwE8Ps33RHwpaeP3w7uywdxK0t4BoasZqGMjEU/edit#) discussion to be done by February 5th, but it is already February 26th.
            * This is due to repeated occurrences where our scheduled came into conflict, and the three of us were unable to meet at the designated time
        * The giveaway event was also supposed to come at an earlier date
* Are we setting goals too high for us?
    * We cannot simply just set unrealistic goals that we don’t have the ability to meet; this is not productive and in the end no one feels good about anything…
    * But to answer the question:
        * We shouldn’t be setting new goals when we haven’t even completed the previous milestones.
* Solutions/actions to take:
    * **To meet deadlines, or change the goal accordingly if we continue to miss these deadlines**
        * In particular, some actions that we intended to help us meet the goal includes the commercial, and giveaway
    * Keep the member count as part of benchmarking 
        * Instead of having monthly milestones, we can instead restructure our goal to be something like: “have _n_ members join the site this week!”, whatever the amount we set might be
    * Better communication amongst ourselves:
        * We should keep doing our weekly calls outside of class, to better communicate what we have already done, and act on any adjustments we should make before our class on Saturday
        * Part of the reason why we stopped doing the in the first place was that it became increasingly difficult to find times that aligned with the three of us
            * To resolve this: we could meet even if only two people can attend, but recap the meeting with the third person afterwards
    * Immediate actions:
        * POST on Instagram:
            * The final version of the commercial
                * Due February 26th
            * The poster outlining the giveaway
                * Add extra details on the change of plans for gift card distribution: we want our participants to know as much as possible
                * Due February 27th in the morning, to possibly increase viewership of the post
            * Contact Canada Sunshine Foundation to publicize our company
            * Improve our Discord server’s usage rate
                * Have Divvybot to remain on 24/7 – find solutions that allows for the bot to be hosted, preferably for free
                * Create system for tracking member joins on the Discord server – this could be done in the form of inviting external bots
            * Due March 5th, but also have something done before next meeting of only the three of us
    * Other actions:
        * Grow our Discord server
            * Maintain activeness in the server
        * Track member joins in the Discord server
            * We can reward people who gets some certain amount of people to join the Discord server
