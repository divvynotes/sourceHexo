**Discussion**

Due Date: Mid January

Actions: First put notes in the average school subjects

Problems: 



* Find ways for us to publicize. 
  * Have a diverse user base. Barriers: Schools, age groups
* Continue the usage of our product
* Make sure that people are posting the notes onto the site
* How to customize our own features onto Buddyboss

Solutions:



1. Advertising:                                                                                                            Subscription emails, instagram/socials account. Discuss our posts as homework every week.                                                                                                                             Post around every 1-2 weeks.                                                                                                     Responsible: everyone.                                                                                                     Due Date: Before January 10 2022 (continuous)                                                    Promote through communication and extracurricular clubs.    
2. Show that we are active. Keep the user base dedicated by making the content relevant and useful by encouraging users to post their notes.                                                      Every week: write one post to make/communicate with the community.         Responsible: all members.                                                                                                                                                  Due Date: continuous.            
3. Engage with them through advertising and social media. Make sure that the application is staying relevant. Potential: Reward system. Find a plug in or code ourselves.                                                                                                                        Responsible: Everyone.                                                                                                                        Due Date: (starts after we publish our application.)
4. Do research, talk to customer support to see if you can change the php code.      Responsible: Chris                                                                                                         Due Date: Before Dec 3rd, 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

Social media Discussion with Justin:



* Find and follow as many people on Instagram to start.
* We should have Instagram as our main form of social media.
* In order to get a bigger following, we should post more and interact more with others.
