Ideas:



* Hire volunteers to write certain amounts of articles and return them volunteer hours
* Make sure to not randomly give out volunteer hours and put it to good use
* Make sure there are not too many volunteers -> each one is responsible for a specific task
* Every month we can hire volunteers to write content and we can put them onto our site in exchange for volunteer hours
    * Can be articles on current events too

Volunteer Tasks:



* Write/design instagram posts
* Write/send out monthly newsletters
* Initiate bi-monthly series that correlate to some particular theme
    * For example: for the next two months, we could invite student volunteers to write a few short (few hundred word) stories to be posted on Divvynotes and possibly onto our Instagram account
* Moderate the site for content that violates policies
    * For example, they can check for content that relate to cheating
    * This more for a later stage where we see more activity and content creation



Actions:



* Find fellow students who will be willing to contribute content by volunteer hours
    * See volunteer tasks for ideas and things they could help out with
    * Responsible: everyone
