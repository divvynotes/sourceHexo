**January 22nd Discussion**

How to deal with zombie users?

Try to get a platform where many people are on it -> Encourage them to start sharing notes/sharing notes in general

**Everyone: **Encourage friends/people from different schools to join. (Connected schools, etc.)

**Julia:** Manage the instagram account and make sure to post content to keep users active and keep a presence.

Add more roles to Divvy notes (if we have more roles, the people are encouraged to manage, use, and post more)



* **Everyone: **Give people moderator roles for each school (make the idea sound appealing)

Use a giftcard as an incentive for activity on Divvynotes. Winner is the one who posts the most. (Either for after 100 users as well or to make people help us reach 100 users, we should already have a developed social media profile.) Probably going to be a lottery with something like 5 posts = 1 entry.



* By around next week (Jan 29, Finish the ad to post onto our social media)
* Two weeks later, finish getting 100 users
* Then start the lotto giveaway

Have a competition with logo designing: Offer compensation on instagram for the best designed logo for our organization.
