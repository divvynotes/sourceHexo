Video Editing Softwares:

Prezi Presentation

Pros:



* Easy to Use
* Presents well and looks neat
* A better alternative to Powerpoint because it presents by itself with transitions
* We don’t have to show our face if we don’t want to
* Can be used as a way of presenting educational things
* Used on Apple and Windows

Cons:



* Not a video ‘editing’ software
* Lots of ‘good’ features are apart of their Premium subscription
* The style is not versatile since it is a presentation website.

Final Cut Pro

Pros:



* Very professional
* Has lots of different features
* Stable and fast optimized for macbook softwares

Cons:



* Extremely pricey ($300)
* Could be out of our function range (usually used by more experienced people on a daily)
* Harder to use
* Not available for Windows, only apple

Premiere Pro 

Pros:



* Can be shared to multiple users
* A lot of functions
* Can be downloaded on apple & windows computers

Cons:



* Only free for 2 ppl (using chris’s acc)
* Hard to use if you haven't edited before

iMovie

Pros:



* Made for all skill levels
* Can be shared to multiple users
* Easy to use

Cons



* Can't be downloaded on windows computer
* Not as many functions as the other softwares
* Takes lots of storage and time to download a video
* Prone to lags

Filmora

Pros:



* Free
* Very easy to use

Cons:



* Unfortunately there is no sharing so we’ll probably have to create a git repository for the project file
* Not very professional
* Has a watermark unless you pay \


Editing for Poster, posts, etc.:

Photoshop (and other Adobe Suite software):

Pros:



* Endless features
* Many tutorials and resources online that is specific to Adobe Photoshop
* Chris and I already have it

Cons:



* Costs a sizeable amount of money $50/month for full suite, &lt;$10/month for Photoshop only
* Even though we already have it, it isn’t ideal that we don’t own or manage the accounts
* Literally very very difficult for beginners (including me) to use
  * Would require some time to learn the ropes of Adobe Photoshop, because of its powerful but complicated tools
* May be slightly unfriendly to older computers (shouldn’t be a problem)

Canva:

Pros:



* Easy to use
* Mostly free
* Easy to share and collaborate on work
* 

Cons:



* Most of the good templates aren’t free
  * Half the stuff is locked behind paid barrier
* Not very professional 
* Lacks advanced tools that professional tools may have (though will we have time or the necessity to make posters this complex?)

The above for Canva mostly applies to all free online image makers/editors online. It’s more of a contrast between professional and paid tools versus free but casual tools. My recommendation is that since Chris and I already have access to all of the tools in the Adobe suite, we could probably use Adobe Suite tools, or we can fund it out of Divvynotes’ pocket for the entire team. 

LMAO Google Slides:

Pros:



* Same as Canva
* Better for collaboration and integration to Google Drive
* All of us already know how to use this (if you don’t there is a problem with your school)

Cons:



* Same as Canva but is worse in every aspect except for collaboration

Procreate

Commercial proposals:



1. Regular, legitimate commercial:
   1. Low-risk
   2. Hard to make such a commercial with high quality
   3. 
2. Mega-cringe anti-humour commercial:
   4. High-risk
   5. Captivating to audience of our age
   6. The nature of advertisements makes it so that if people dislike an ad, they simply will forget about it, and not harbour any negative opinions, but if they like it, they may pursue it further

What to do:



* We need a script: someone needs to write this
  * This should include some characters, dialogue, otherwise
  * 
* Cast (could be us) 
* We need to be mindful of how we portray the students in the cast

Questions to answer:



* What would be the best format to present the perfect cringe commercial?
  * In general, we want to convey to viewers our primary features and/or values: like our forums, groups, etc.. No matter how much cringe we put in this commercial, our only guideline is that we have to communicate what has been mentioned above.
  * We could have an announcer saying: dO yOu WaNt To StOp FaIlInG tEsTs???, then do some obviously scripted interview of equally absurd calibre
  * Interview only: ask super obvious questions
  * WE NEED INSPIRATION FOR HOMEWORK WE WATCH CRINGE COMMERCIAL COMPILATIONS
